# DS200 Assignment: Data Science Visualization Project  

This repository contains two data analysis and visualization projects created as part of the **DS200: Data Science Visualization** assignment.  
Both projects use datasets from [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in) and demonstrate **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** using Python (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`).

### Overview  
This project analyzes **Research & Development (R&D) expenditure** across various economic sectors in India for the fiscal years **2018â€“19, 2019â€“20, and 2020â€“21**.  
It identifies key trends, top-spending sectors, and the inequality in national R&D investment.

### ðŸ§  Observations and Inferences  

#### 1. R&D Expenditure (2018â€“19 vs. 2019â€“20)
**Observation:** Most sectors lie close to the *y = x* line with a slight upward drift; one dominant outlier stands out.  
**Inference:** Overall spending increased between years, with the *Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities* sector dominating.

#### 2. Distribution of R&D Expenditure (2018â€“2021)
**Observation:** Data is highly right-skewed, showing a few sectors with very high spending.  
**Inference:** R&D investment is heavily concentrated in select industries, revealing inequality in innovation funding.

#### 3. Top 10 Sectors by Expenditure (2020â€“21)
**Observation:** The *Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities* sector far outspends all others, followed by *Agriculture* and *Health*.  
**Inference:** National priorities favor scientific and technical R&D, with notable emphasis on agriculture and healthcare.

## ðŸŽ“ Project 2: Analysis of Indian School Education Performance Data  

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/your_colab_link_here)

### Overview  
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **Performance Grading Index for Districts (PGI-D 2023â€“24)** dataset.  
It visualizes educational performance across districts, grades, and states to uncover relationships among key evaluation categories.

**Data Source:** [Performance Grading Index for Districts (PGI-D 2023â€“24) â€“ data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/)

### ðŸ§  Observations and Inferences  

#### 1. Overall vs. Outcome Score  
**Observation:** Strong positive linear correlation between *Outcome* and *Overall* scores.  
**Inference:** Districts with better learning outcomes tend to achieve higher overall scores â€” confirming internal data consistency.

#### 2. Distribution of Scores by Grade  
**Observation:** Higher grades (*Uttam*) have higher medians and broader ranges; lower grades (*Prachesta*) cluster at lower scores.  
**Inference:** Grade classifications effectively represent district-level education performance bands.

#### 3. Top States by Average Overall Score  
**Observation:** *Punjab*, *Chandigarh*, and *Rajasthan* lead with the highest average district scores.  
**Inference:** These states exhibit strong educational governance and outcomes, though intra-state variation persists.
